======================================================================

  Dependencies
  ------------

  This project was built using the frameworks Laravel 5.4 for the
  backend and Angular 6.0 on the frontend.

  Minimum system requirements:

  * Apache >= 2.4
  * MySQL >= 5.6
  * PHP >= 5.6.4
  * Mbstring PHP Extension
  * PDO PHP Extension
  * Tokenizer PHP Extension
  * XML PHP Extension


  Before installation
  -------------------

  Sinapsi uses Google Cloud Platform to authenticate users. Please,
  create your application and credentials using the following
  information. Where {host} is your application domain.

  Authorized JavaScript origins:    https://{host}
  Authorized redirect URIs:         https://{host}/accounts/login


  Database creation
  -----------------

  From inside the «database» folder execute the database creation SQL
  script «sinapsi.sql». The script assumes that no database named
  «sinapsi» exists and creates it. Make sure your MySQL user was granted
  the CREATE and FILE privileges before executing the script.

  For example:

  $ mysql -u -p --force --local-infile < sinapsi.sql


  Install the application
  -----------------------

  Copy the files from the «application» folder to a suitable folder on
  your server (i.e. /var/www/sinapsi) and set the required permissions
  for the files. You can use the included PERMISSIONS file as a reference.


  Setup the system
  ----------------

  In order to scrap the feeds automatically a cron task and the
  queue listener service must be configured. Copy the files found on
  the «system» folder to appropriate locations for your system and make
  sure they have the right permissions.

  If required, configure the extracted files to suit your system.

  The included files are:

  Cron task:            /etc/cron.d/sinapsi
  Systemd Unit File:    /etc/systemd/system/sinapsi-queue.service
  Virtual Host File:    /etc/apache2/sites-available/sinapsi.conf


  Configure the application
  -------------------------

  Edit the .env file that can be found on the installation folder
  (i.e. /var/www/sinapsi/.env) and configure it according to your system
  settings. Change the APP_URL to point to your domain and configure the
  database, mail and authentication sections to suit your needs.

  To generate a new encryption key you can use the key:generate artisan
  command. For example, issuing:

  $ php /var/www/sinapsi/artisan key:generate


  Configure the logs
  ------------------

  The application logs can be found on the /storage/logs folder
  inside your application location (i.e. /var/www/sinapsi/storage/logs).

  If required, you can move them to another location by creating a
  hard link to that folder. Make sure the folder and its contents have
  the right permissions, or else the application will not run.


  Reload the services
  -------------------

  At this point, the cron task, the queue service and the web server
  configuration must be reloaded. Ensure the virtual host is enabled.

  For example:

  $ systemctl daemon-reload
  $ systemctl start sinapsi-queue.service

  $ service cron force-reload

  $ a2ensite sinapsi.conf
  $ service apache2 reload


  Start the application
  ---------------------

  Make sure the application is not in maintenance mode. After that
  Sinapsi should be up and running.

  For example:

  $ php /var/www/sinapsi/artisan up
